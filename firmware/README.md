## This firmware is deprecated for the time being.

[George Norton's Headphones firmware](https://github.com/george-norton/headphones/tree/headphones-toolbox) is now considered the defacto standard Headphones firmware. You can find firmware binaries [here](https://github.com/george-norton/headphones/releases).

From 23 June 2023 and onwards, kits will ship with the headphones-toolbox firmware.

Also, if you haven't already, you should also check out [George Norton's Headphones Toolbox](https://github.com/george-norton/headphones-toolbox), which is an app that interfaces with the DAC and allows you to change the tuning of the DSP in real-time. You can find compiled binaries [here](https://github.com/george-norton/headphones-toolbox/releases/tag/headphones-toolbox-beta-v1).
